**🛒 Sales Store – SQL Analytics Project (SQL Server)**

**📘 Introduction**

This project delivers a complete **SQL Server**–based analysis of a retail store’s sales dataset.
The objective is to convert raw transactional data into meaningful insights centered around product performance, customer behavior, payment patterns, cancellations, and operational efficiency.

All insights are generated using optimized T-SQL queries running in Microsoft SQL Server. To see whole project click [sqlproject1.sql](./sqlproject1.sql)


**Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL Server)**

The raw dataset required multiple cleaning steps before analysis.
All cleaning operations were performed using T-SQL in SQL Server.

**1️⃣ Creating a Working Copy of the Dataset**

A duplicate table was created to ensure the original dataset remains untouched.

```sql SELECT * INTO sales FROM sales_store;```

2️⃣ Checking for Duplicate Records
SELECT transaction_id, COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount
FROM sales
GROUP BY transaction_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;


Duplicate Transaction IDs found:

TXN240646

TXN342128

TXN855235

TXN981773

Removing Duplicate Rows Using CTE
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY transaction_id ORDER BY transaction_id) AS Row_Num
    FROM sales
)
DELETE FROM CTE
WHERE Row_Num = 2;

3️⃣ Fixing Incorrect Column Names
EXEC sp_rename 'sales.quantiy', 'quantity', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'sales.prce', 'price', 'COLUMN';

4️⃣ Checking Data Types of All Columns
SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sales';

5️⃣ Checking for NULL Values in Every Column

A dynamic SQL script was used to automatically check NULL counts column-wise.

DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX) = '';

SELECT @SQL = STRING_AGG(
    'SELECT ''' + COLUMN_NAME + ''' AS ColumnName, 
    COUNT(*) AS NullCount 
    FROM sales 
    WHERE ' + QUOTENAME(COLUMN_NAME) + ' IS NULL',
    ' UNION ALL '
)
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sales';

EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;

6️⃣ Treating NULL Values
Identifying Rows Containing NULL Values
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR customer_name IS NULL
   OR customer_age IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR product_id IS NULL
   OR product_name IS NULL
   OR product_category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR payment_mode IS NULL
   OR purchase_date IS NULL
   OR status IS NULL
   OR price IS NULL;

Removing Invalid Rows
DELETE FROM sales
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL;

Correcting Individual Records
UPDATE sales
SET customer_id = 'CUST9494'
WHERE transaction_id = 'TXN977900';

UPDATE sales
SET customer_id = 'CUST1401'
WHERE transaction_id = 'TXN985663';

UPDATE sales
SET customer_name = 'Mahika Saini',
    customer_age = 35,
    gender = 'Male'
WHERE transaction_id = 'TXN432798';

7️⃣ Standardizing Categorical Values
Gender Standardization
SELECT DISTINCT gender FROM sales;

UPDATE sales SET gender = 'M' WHERE gender = 'Male';
UPDATE sales SET gender = 'F' WHERE gender = 'Female';

Payment Mode Standardization
SELECT DISTINCT payment_mode FROM sales;

UPDATE sales
SET payment_mode = 'Credit Card'
WHERE payment_mode = 'CC';

**✔️ Summary of Cleaning Work**

Duplicate rows identified and removed

Misspelled column names fixed

Data types validated

NULL values identified and handled

Incorrect or missing customer data corrected

Gender standardized to M/F

Payment mode standardized

Ensured data consistency for accurate analysis


**🧩 Project Background**

Although the store records daily sales transactions, it lacks clarity on key business metrics:

#1 Which products sell the most.

#2 Who are the highest-value customers.

#3 Which categories generate the most revenue.

#4 Which products/category have high cancellation rates.

#5 Payment mode usage patterns.

#6 Peak purchasing times

#7 Customer demographic insights.



**❗ Business Problems & SQL Solutions**

Each problem below includes the SQL Server query used to solve it.

1️⃣ Problem: No visibility of top-selling products


✅ Query: Top 5 Best-Selling Products (by quantity)

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(o.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC;
```


2️⃣ Problem: Store doesn't know which products get cancelled the most
✅ Query: Most Frequently Cancelled Products
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    COUNT(*) AS cancel_count
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_status = 'Cancelled'
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY cancel_count DESC;

3️⃣ Problem: No clarity on top-spending customers
✅ Query: Top 5 Highest Spending Customers
SELECT TOP 5
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(o.quantity * o.price) AS total_spend
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.order_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;

4️⃣ Problem: No understanding of category revenue
✅ Query: Revenue by Product Category
SELECT
    p.category,
    SUM(o.quantity * o.price) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

5️⃣ Problem: High returns/cancellations but store doesn't know where
✅ Query: Cancellation Rate by Category
SELECT
    p.category,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN o.order_status = 'Cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) 
        / COUNT(*) AS cancellation_rate

**💼 Key Analytical Insights (Summary)**

Based on the SQL analysis:

Certain products dominate overall sales volume

Some categories show high cancellation rates, impacting revenue

A small set of customers generate a large % of total sales

Payment modes vary by customer demographic

Evening hours show significantly higher order volume

Certain age groups (26–35 typically) contribute most revenue

Gender influences purchasing category choices

Monthly trends show seasonal spikes that can be leveraged

**💡 Business Recommendations (How Store Can Increase Revenue)**

These recommendations translate SQL insights into actionable strategy:

1. Prioritize Stocking Top-Selling Products

Avoid stockouts → directly increases sales volume.

2. Fix High-Cancellation Items

Investigate:

Delivery delays

Poor product quality

Wrong item images/descriptions

Incorrect pricing

Reducing cancellations = instant profit improvement.

3. Launch Loyalty Programs for High-Value Customers

Offer:

Cashback

Exclusive discounts

Early access to sales

Boosts repeat purchases.

4. Promote High-Revenue Categories

Run:

Bundled deals

Category-specific offers

Sponsored ads

5. Improve Low-Performing Categories

Check:

Inventory issues

Low visibility

Price competitiveness

Customer feedback

6. Time-Based Discounting

Example:

High peak in evenings → run flash deals

Low morning sales → introduce morning offers

7. Personalize Marketing by Age Group

18–25 → gadgets, fashion
26–35 → home & lifestyle
36–50 → family essentials

8. Encourage Digital Payments

If COD is high →
Offer “5% discount on prepaid orders” to reduce delivery failures.
