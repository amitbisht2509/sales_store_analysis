**🛒 Sales Store – SQL Analytics Project (SQL Server)**

**📘 Introduction**

This project delivers a complete **SQL Server**–based analysis of a retail store’s sales dataset.
The objective is to convert raw transactional data into meaningful insights centered around product performance, customer behavior, payment patterns, cancellations, and operational efficiency.

All insights are generated using optimized T-SQL queries running in Microsoft SQL Server.

**🧩 Project Background**

Although the store records daily sales transactions, it lacks clarity on key business metrics:

#1 Which products sell the most.

#2 Who are the highest-value customers.

#3 Which categories generate the most revenue.

#4 Which products/category have high cancellation rates.

#5 Payment mode usage patterns.

#6 Peak purchasing times

#7 Customer demographic insights.

ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

**💼 Key Analytical Insights (Summary)**

Based on the SQL analysis:

Certain products dominate overall sales volume

Some categories show high cancellation rates, impacting revenue

A small set of customers generate a large % of total sales

Payment modes vary by customer demographic

Evening hours show significantly higher order volume

Certain age groups (26–35 typically) contribute most revenue

Gender influences purchasing category choices

Monthly trends show seasonal spikes that can be leveraged
